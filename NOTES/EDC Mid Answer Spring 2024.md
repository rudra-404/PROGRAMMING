## **EDC Spring 2024 MID Questions Answer**

### **Q1 (a) - Definitions**
1. **Intrinsic Material** :  
   Intrinsic material is a pure semiconductor material that has no impurities. Its electrical conductivity is very low because it has an equal number of electrons and holes. Examples include pure silicon or germanium.

2. **n-Type Material** :  
   n-Type material is a semiconductor doped with donor impurities (e.g., phosphorus or arsenic) that provide extra electrons, making electrons the majority charge carriers.

3. **Depletion Region** :  
   The depletion region in a p-n junction is the region around the junction where mobile charge carriers (electrons and holes) are depleted, leaving behind only immobile ions. This creates an electric field that opposes further diffusion of carriers.

4. **Ideal Diode** :  
   An ideal diode is a theoretical diode that acts as a perfect conductor when forward-biased and a perfect insulator when reverse-biased, with zero resistance in the forward direction and infinite resistance in the reverse direction.

5. **PIV (Peak Inverse Voltage)** :  
   Peak Inverse Voltage is the maximum voltage a diode can withstand in the reverse-biased condition without breaking down or getting damaged.

### **Q2 (a) - Explanation of Phenomena**
1. **No Applied Bias Condition** :  
   When no external voltage is applied across a p-n junction, diffusion of charge carriers occurs, creating a depletion region and a built-in potential. The junction remains neutral overall.

2. **Forward Bias Condition** :  
   In forward bias, the positive terminal is connected to the p-side, and the negative terminal is connected to the n-side. This reduces the depletion width, allowing current to flow as electrons and holes recombine.

3. **Reverse Bias Condition** :  
   In reverse bias, the positive terminal is connected to the n-side, and the negative terminal is connected to the p-side. This widens the depletion region and prevents current flow except for a small leakage current due to minority carriers.

4. **Electron vs. Hole Flow** :  
   Electrons are negatively charged carriers that move from the n-side to the p-side, while holes are positively charged carriers that move from the p-side to the n-side. Both contribute to current flow in a semiconductor.

5. **Load Line Analysis** :  
   Load line analysis is a graphical technique used to determine the operating point of a circuit by plotting the load line on the IV characteristics of a diode or transistor.

### **Q3 (a) - Output Wave Shape**
1. **Rectifier Circuit Analysis** :  
   - The first part of the circuit is a full-wave rectifier with diodes. The input sinusoidal waveform will be converted into a full-wave rectified output.
   - The capacitor in the circuit smoothens the output waveform by reducing ripples, resulting in a nearly constant DC output.

2. **Voltage Clipping Circuit** :  
   - The zener diode in the circuit clips the output voltage to maintain it around 5V when the input voltage exceeds the breakdown voltage.

**Output Wave Shape** :  
The output waveform will consist of a smooth DC voltage with slight ripples due to the capacitor's smoothing effect. The zener diode ensures the voltage does not exceed 5V.
